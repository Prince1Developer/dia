                <p>Living with diabetes requires daily care and attention. As the carer of someone living with diabetes, you are a vital member of their healthcare team.  

                    You might help them with their medication, make and accompany them to medical appointments or help with their day-to-day living needs. Your support is absolutely vital to their health and wellbeing. 
                    
                    When caring for someone with diabetes, having a care plan from their doctor can give you helpful guidance and structure around how best to support them. Talking with their diabetes team, GP, or a practice nurse about their care needs can also help you access services like homecare nursing. This can offer you some down time and help to support the quality care you provide.  
                    
                    Caring for someone with diabetes can be challenging at times. <b>It’s very important that you get the support you need to manage your own well-being.</b> It may be useful to explore your local community for support programs so that you don’t feel alone in facing these challenges.</p>

                <p>With young children, incorporating play into their diabetes routine can really help.
