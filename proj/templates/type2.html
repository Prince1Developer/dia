                    </div>
                    <p>Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which the body becomes resistant to the normal effects of insulin and gradually loses the capacity to produce enough insulin in the pancreas. The condition has strong genetic and family-related (non-modifiable) risk factors and is also often associated with modifiable lifestyle risk factors. We do not know the exact genetic causes of type 2 diabetes. People may be able to significantly slow or even stop the progression of the condition through changes to diet and increasing the amount of physical activity they do</p>
                    Type 2 diabetes:
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Is diagnosed when blood glucose levels are high due to insulin produced by the pancreas not working effectively and/or the cells of the body do not respond to insulin effectively (known as insulin resistance), over time the condition progresses and the pancreas does not produce enough insulin (reduced insulin production)</p></li>
                        <li><p>Represents 85–90 percent of all cases of diabetes</p></li>
                        <li><p>Usually develops in adults over the age of 45 years but is increasingly occurring in younger age groups including children, adolescents, and young adults</p></li>
                        <li><p>Is more likely in people with a family history of type 2 diabetes or from particular ethnic backgrounds</p></li>
                        <li><p>For some, the first sign may be a complication of diabetes such as a heart attack, vision problems or a wound that does not heal well</p></li>

            <h1>What happens with type 2 diabetes? </h1>
            </div>
            <p>Type 2 diabetes develops over a long period of time (years). During this period of time insulin resistance starts, this is where the insulin is increasingly ineffective at managing the blood glucose levels. As a result of this insulin resistance, the pancreas responds by producing greater and greater amounts of insulin, to try and achieve some degree of management of the blood glucose levelsi.</p>
            <p>As insulin overproduction occurs over a very long period of time, the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas wear themselves out, so that by the time someone is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, they have lost 50 – 70% of their insulin-producing cells. This means type 2 diabetes is a combination of ineffective insulin and not enough insulin. Lifestyle changes may be able to slow this process in some people. </p>
<p>Initially, type 2 diabetes can often be managed with healthy eating and regular physical activity. Over time many people with type 2 diabetes will also need tablets, and/or non-insulin injectable medications and many eventually require insulin injections. It is important to note that this is normal, and taking tablets, non-insulin injectable medications or insulin as soon as they are required can result in fewer long-term complications.</p>

            <h1>What causes type 2 diabetes?</h1>
            </div>
            <p>Diabetes runs in the family. If you have a family member with diabetes, you have a genetic disposition to the condition.While people may have a strong genetic disposition towards type 2 diabetes, the risk is greatly increased if people display a number of modifiable lifestyle factors including high blood pressure, being overweight, not being active enough, eating a poor diet and having the classic ‘apple shape’ body where extra weight is carried around the waist.</p>

                <li><p>Are older (over 55 years of age) – the risk increases as we age</p></li>

            <p>Many people with type 2 diabetes have no symptoms. As type 2 diabetes is commonly (but not always) diagnosed at a later age, sometimes signs are dismissed as a part of ‘getting older’. In some cases, by the time type 2 diabetes is diagnosed, the long-term complications of diabetes may already be present.</p>
